# Image Classification - Gunting Batu Kertas

This project is for [Dicoding Class Submission](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/184/). We created a convolutional neural network model to detect hand gestures from the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The dataset contains a total of 2188 images corresponding to the 'Rock' (726 images), 'Paper' (710 images) and 'Scissors' (752 images) hand gestures of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. All image are taken on a green background with relatively consistent ligithing and white balance. The sample pictures from the dataset is:

We added upload widget to the notebook to test the model using our own hand gestures. This is my own hand predictied using the model. The gesture paper is correctly classified as paper.

The notebook is run in the Google Colab, you can access the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EP8QR8nre19hI9h93x8Lhi_9RQMvpnFg?usp=sharing).
